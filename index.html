            <i>Lee Kuan Yew, often referred to as LKY, was a Singaporean politician and statesman who is widely regarded as the founding father of modern Singapore. He served as the country's Prime Minister for 31 years, from 1959 to 1990, and remained a prominent figure in Singaporean politics until his death in 2015.
            During his tenure as Prime Minister, Lee implemented a series of policies focused on economic development, public housing, education, and healthcare. He recognized that Singapore's greatest resource was its people, and he invested heavily in education and skills training to create a highly skilled workforce that could compete on the global stage.
            One of Lee's most notable achievements was transforming Singapore from a third-world country into a modern, prosperous nation. He worked tirelessly to attract foreign investment, establish trade relationships with other countries, and develop Singapore's infrastructure, which helped to make the country a hub for international business and finance.
